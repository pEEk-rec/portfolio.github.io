<div class="container">
    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Gloabalia, a smart city near Goa, spanning 1500 square feet, designed to showcase how technology and sustainability can coexist. At the core of this vision is the tidal range power plant, which harnesses the energy of tides to provide clean, reliable electricity. Using advanced algorithms, we ensure that energy is distributed efficiently, minimizing losses while maximizing environmental benefits.</p>
        <p>This project aligns with global sustainability goals, focusing on smart urban planning and renewable energy integration.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Alignment with Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 11</h2>
        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Target 11.6</h3>
            <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities by 2030, with emphasis on air quality and waste management.</p>
            <p><strong>Indicator:</strong> Reduction in carbon emissions through tidal energy adoption.</p>
            <p><strong>Metric:</strong> Energy generated per kilowatt-hour (kWh) with zero emissions.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Target 11.3</h3>
            <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Enhance sustainable urbanization and strengthen integrated, sustainable human settlement planning by 2030.</p>
            <p><strong>Indicator:</strong> Proportion of cities with participatory urban planning.</p>
            <p><strong>Metric:</strong> Coverage ratio of energy distribution from the tidal plant to urban demand centers.</p>
        </div>
        <p>By aligning with these targets, Gloabalia sets an example for sustainable city development, balancing technology with environmental stewardship.</p>

        <h2>Project Objectives</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Efficient Location Selection:</strong> Use a simple sorting algorithm to identify the best location for the tidal range power plant, ensuring minimal environmental and economic costs.</li>
            <li><strong>Optimized Energy Distribution:</strong> Implement advanced algorithms to minimize energy losses while distributing power to city sectors effectively.</li>
            <li><strong>Sustainability First:</strong> Establish Gloabalia as a leader in renewable energy while maintaining ecological harmony.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Energy Demand Sorting and Distribution</h2>
        <h3>Step 1: Choosing the Tidal Plant Location</h3>
        <p>Key factors for site selection include tidal range, proximity to the city, environmental impact, and economic feasibility.</p>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Algorithm for Location Selection:</strong></p>
            <p>Input: Tidal range, distance from the city, environmental impact score, and infrastructure cost for each potential site.</p>
            <p>Sorting Method: A simple sorting algorithm ranks sites based on weighted suitability scores.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Step 2: Sorting Energy Demand by Sector</h3>
        <p>Objective: Sort city sectors based on their energy demands (low to high) to ensure effective power allocation.</p>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Algorithm:</strong> Quick Sort is used to arrange sectors in ascending order of demand.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Optimizing Energy Transmission</h2>
        <p>Objective: Ensure minimal energy loss during transmission from the tidal plant to the city’s sectors.</p>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Algorithm:</strong> Dijkstra’s Algorithm calculates the shortest paths for energy transmission.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Why Tidal Range Power for Gloabalia?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Predictability and Reliability:</strong> Tides, driven by the moon’s gravitational pull, are highly predictable, ensuring consistent energy generation compared to intermittent solar and wind power.</li>
            <li><strong>High Energy Potential:</strong> Tidal power is capable of generating energy equivalent to or greater than wind turbines, thanks to the high density of water.</li>
            <li><strong>Compact and Efficient:</strong> Tidal range projects require smaller infrastructure than wind farms but deliver substantial power.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>High Costs:</strong> Although initial costs are high, long-term benefits outweigh the expense. Government funding and innovative designs can reduce costs further.</li>
            <li><strong>Environmental Concerns:</strong> Lagoon-based designs minimize harm to marine life and preserve ecosystems.</li>
            <li><strong>Operational Challenges:</strong> Advanced materials and maintenance techniques combat issues like corrosion and biofouling.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The tidal range power plant in Gloabalia demonstrates how clean energy, innovative technology, and sustainable urban planning can transform a city into a beacon of progress. By addressing site selection, energy distribution, and environmental concerns, this project exemplifies how smart cities can align with global sustainability goals.</p>
        <p>Gloabalia stands as a testament to the power of vision and action, paving the way for a greener, smarter future.</p>
