            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The development of a <strong>smart city</strong> in Goa, covering 1500 sq. km, presents a unique opportunity to integrate <strong>sustainable energy solutions</strong>. Among these, <strong>tidal energy</strong> stands out as a renewable and highly predictable resource that can significantly meet the city's energy demands while supporting <strong>Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11</strong>: Sustainable Cities and Communities. Harnessing Goa's coastal geography and tidal patterns, this project aims to provide consistent power, reduce carbon emissions, and contribute to sustainable urban planning through an efficient energy grid.</p>

            <h2>Why Renewable Energy for Goa?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Estuaries for Tidal Energy:</strong> Goa's estuaries like the <strong>Mandovi</strong> and <strong>Zuari Rivers</strong> are ideal for harnessing tidal movement to produce energy.</li>
                <li><strong>Moderate Tidal Range:</strong> The 2-3 meter tidal range supports the use of <strong>low-head turbines</strong> to generate electricity efficiently.</li>
                <li><strong>Complementary Solar & Wind Energy:</strong> Goa’s sunny days (300 per year) and moderate coastal winds enhance the potential for a diversified renewable energy mix.</li>
                <li><strong>Efficient Urban Supply:</strong> Goa’s small size ensures minimal transmission losses, enabling efficient distribution of power across urban centers.</li>
            </ul>
