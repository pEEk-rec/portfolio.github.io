        <h1>Tidal Energy Plant for Smart City Development in Globalia</h1>
    </header>

    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Globalia, a smart city near Goa spanning 1500 square feet, is envisioned as a model for sustainable urban living. This innovative city leverages renewable energy and cutting-edge technology to integrate green infrastructure and achieve energy efficiency. At the core of this effort is a tidal energy plant, designed to harness predictable tidal power to generate clean electricity. By employing advanced algorithms for location selection, energy distribution, and grid optimization, Globalia aims to reduce its environmental impact and foster sustainable development.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Why Tidal Energy for Globalia?</h2>
        <p>Tidal energy is a reliable and sustainable renewable energy source driven by the moon's gravitational pull. Its key benefits include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Predictability:</strong> Tidal cycles are consistent and unaffected by weather changes.</li>
            <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> The density of water enables significant energy generation even with smaller turbines.</li>
            <li><strong>Environmental Compatibility:</strong> Tidal energy has minimal visual impact and contributes to zero-emission electricity generation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Globalia’s proximity to coastal estuaries makes it an ideal location for implementing tidal barrage technology.</p>

        <h2>Implementation Stage</h2>
        <h3>Tidal Energy Power Plant Types</h3>
        <p>There are two types of tidal energy plants:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tidal Stream Power:</strong> Uses underwater turbines to harness tidal currents.</li>
            <li><strong>Tidal Range Power (Barrage):</strong> Traps water in estuaries to generate power during tidal flows.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Globalia’s moderate tidal ranges and estuaries make tidal barrage technology the best choice.</p>

        <h3>Phase 1: Location Selection for the Power Plant</h3>
        <p>Factors for selecting the best site:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tidal range for energy potential.</li>
            <li>Proximity to the city to reduce costs.</li>
            <li>Minimal environmental disruption.</li>
            <li>Cost-effectiveness for construction and operation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Potential sites are ranked using a scoring algorithm. Sorting ensures the highest-ranked site is selected for development.</p>

        <h3>Phase 2: Sorting Energy Demand by Sectors</h3>
        <p>Energy demands of city sectors are prioritized using Quick Sort, ensuring efficient distribution to high-demand areas first.</p>

        <h3>Phase 3: Optimized Energy Grid Management</h3>
        <p>Dijkstra’s Algorithm ensures minimal energy loss by calculating the shortest transmission paths from the power plant to urban sectors.</p>
