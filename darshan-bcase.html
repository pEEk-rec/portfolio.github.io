    <h1>TRANSPORTATION</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Introduction to Business Case</h2>
        <p>
            A well-knit and coordinated system of transport plays an important role in the sustained economic growth of a country. 
            The transport system of India comprises various modes of transport including rail, road, coastal shipping, air transport, etc.
        </p>

        <h2>Facilitating Trade and Commerce</h2>
        <p>
            It enables the movement of goods and services from production centers to markets, both domestically and internationally. Efficient transportation networks reduce costs, improve accessibility, and foster economic growth by connecting producers to consumers.
        </p>

        <h2>Employment Generation</h2>
        <p>
            The transport sector creates jobs directly in areas like logistics, driving, maintenance, and indirectly in supporting industries such as manufacturing (vehicle production), etc.
        </p>

        <h2>Global Competitiveness</h2>
        <p>
            Countries with efficient transport systems can compete better in international markets by offering quicker and more cost-effective transportation of goods, thus enhancing their global competitiveness.
        </p>

        <h2>Connectivity and Accessibility</h2>
        <p>
            Transportation networks connect remote areas to urban centers, providing access to essential services, markets, and opportunities. This connectivity helps bridge economic disparities and encourages regional development.
        </p>

        <h2>Profit Domains</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Ticket Sales:</strong> The primary source of revenue comes from passengers purchasing tickets for their travel. HDBRTS employs smart cards, QR-coded paper tickets, and off-board ticketing systems to ensure efficient fare collection.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Public Funding:</strong> As a public transit project, HDBRTS receives funding from government bodies, including initial investments for infrastructure development and operational subsidies.
        </p>

        <h2>Problems Faced by Road Transport in India</h2>
        <p><strong>1. India's cities account for 53% of the total vehicle population, despite having only 2% of the world's road network.</strong> Annual traffic delays cost ₹1.47 lakh crore ($18 billion) in terms of lost productivity in major cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Kolkata.</p>
        <p><strong>SDG Mapping:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Target 11.2:</strong> Provide access to safe, affordable, and sustainable transport systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Indicator 11.2.1:</strong> Proportion of the population with convenient access to public transport.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>2. According to official statistics published by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH), 153,972 persons were killed in road crashes in the year 2021.</strong> This corresponds to 11.3 deaths per 100,000 population.</p>
        <p><strong>SDG Mapping:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Target 3.6:</strong> Halve the number of global deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents.</li>
            <li><strong>Indicator 3.6.1:</strong> Death rate due to road traffic injuries.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>3. Transport contributes to 23% of CO2 emissions in India, with road transport as the largest contributor.</strong> Vehicular emissions are responsible for 36% of PM2.5 pollution in cities like Delhi.</p>
        <p><strong>SDG Mapping:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Target 11.6:</strong> Reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including air quality.</li>
            <li><strong>Indicator 11.6.2:</strong> Annual mean levels of fine particulate matter (e.g., PM2.5).</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>4. India has only 0.8 buses per 1,000 people, significantly below the global average of 6 per 1,000 people.</strong> The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) recommends a fleet size of 40–60 buses per 1 lakh population, yet most Indian cities fall short of this benchmark.</p>
        <p><strong>SDG Mapping:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Target 11.2:</strong> Focuses on providing safe, affordable, and sustainable transport systems with a special emphasis on public transport.</li>
            <li><strong>Indicator 11.2.1:</strong> Measures the proportion of the population with convenient access to public transport, which remains low in India due to the inadequate bus density and lack of integrated urban transport systems.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Traffic Congestion as Main Problem</h2>
        <p>
            Traffic congestion is a real problem facing people every day, especially those that live in major cities. Critically analyzing this problem, a lot of time and money is lost in the traffic snarl-ups, therefore greatly contributing to the stunted economic growth in the country. As a result, many people prefer to wake up way early and start to travel at the wee hours when there are fewer motorists on the road. However, the evening traffic still catches up with them as they go back to their places of residence after work.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most of these people get home late due to the traffic, and adding to the fatigue of the people, they are quite unproductive in the evening. Thus, they only get rest and prepare for the next day’s work. As a result, a reliable and efficient system is necessary to route vehicles to roads with the less dense traffic. This system must provide the precise information needed to improve the traffic situation.
        </p>

        <h2>Methodology and Design</h2>
        <p>
            The design of our research requires the conversion of a map of a road network to a suitable graph with nodes and weighted edges. The nodes represent the road intersections, while the edges represent the roads, and the weights are given depending on the length of the road and its traffic density.
        </p>

        <h2>Algorithm Used Here</h2>
        <p>
            We primarily use Dijkstra’s algorithm to determine the shortest path. The algorithm is implemented using C++.
        </p>

        <h2>SIMULATION</h2>
        <p>
            To simulate the working of the algorithm, a road network map of major roads is converted into a graph. The time taken to move from one location to another is obtained from Google Maps by use of a public API. Dijkstra’s algorithm is applied to the graph where one inputs the origin and the destination, and the algorithm returns the fastest route and the shortest time a car is likely to take. Several tests are conducted by running the program at different times.
