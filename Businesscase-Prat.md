## Why Renewable Energy for Goa?

Goa’s natural environment is well-suited for integrating multiple renewable energy sources, including **tidal**, **solar**, and **wind**. Key factors include:

- **Estuaries for Tidal Energy:** Goa's estuaries like the **Mandovi** and **Zuari Rivers** are ideal for harnessing tidal movement to produce energy.
- **Moderate Tidal Range:** The 2-3 meter tidal range supports the use of **low-head turbines** to generate electricity efficiently.
- **Complementary Solar & Wind Energy:** Goa’s sunny days (300 per year) and moderate coastal winds enhance the potential for a diversified renewable energy mix.
- **Efficient Urban Supply:** Goa’s small size ensures minimal transmission losses, enabling efficient distribution of power across urban centers.

## Feasibility Analysis

### Geographical Suitability:
- Goa’s **160-km coastline** offers several estuaries for potential tidal energy plants.
- Advanced **turbine technologies** can optimize energy production from moderate tidal conditions.

### Environmental Impact:
- Detailed **environmental assessments** will minimize ecological disruption and protect marine life.

### Economic Viability:
- While initial costs for site assessments and turbine installation are high, the project is economically viable with long-term operational savings.
- The tidal plant is expected to operate for **50-100 years** with low maintenance costs.

## Implementation Stage

### Energy Demand Sorting and Distribution

Once the tidal energy plant is operational, the next step is to distribute energy effectively across the city using **sorting** and **graph algorithms**.

---

### Step 1: Sorting the City Sectors

**Objective:**  
Sort the city’s sectors based on their energy demand to prioritize energy distribution.

**Algorithm:**  
- **Quick Sort** will be used to arrange sectors in order of energy demand (low to high). This ensures that high-demand sectors receive power first.

**Input:**  
- Each sector’s energy demand (in kWh).

**How it Works:**  
- The algorithm sorts the sectors by their energy needs.
- Higher-demand sectors are given priority for energy distribution.

---

### Step 2: Efficient Energy Distribution Using Graph Algorithm

**Objective:**  
Use a **Graph Algorithm** (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) to optimize the flow of energy from the tidal plant to each sector.

**Algorithm:**  
- **Dijkstra’s algorithm** calculates the shortest path for energy transmission, minimizing energy loss and transmission costs.

**Input:**  
- Energy demand of each sector.
- **Graph representation** of the city, with nodes representing sectors and edges representing energy transmission routes, each with associated weights (transmission loss).

**How it Works:**  
- Each sector is a node, and energy transmission lines are edges in the graph.
- Dijkstra’s algorithm calculates the optimal route to minimize energy loss.
- Energy is distributed to sectors via the shortest paths, ensuring efficient grid management.


Dijkstra’s algorithm identifies the most efficient path for energy transmission.
